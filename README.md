We have two sections:

1) traditional biomarker detection (t.test between cases and controls). 

1a) On the annotated metabolties (that is, the metabolites we could identify with online databases)

1b) On the unannotated metabolites (We could not label them)

2) Datamining on the whole Guthrie card - imagine we are willing to mass-spec every newborn's blood drop. How well can we detect JMML?
